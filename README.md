# Diabetes-Predictive-Modeling
This project's main objective is to successfully use machine learning to forecast diabetic health markers. This includes identifying patients at risk early, optimizing treatment regimens, and lowering complications related to diabetes. The goal is to create machine learning models that, given a set of independent factors, can precisely predict diabetes health markers. These health indicators might cover a range of risk factors and diabetes control strategies

The source of the data is kaggle, which contained a subset of the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey conducted by the Center for Disease and Control. Our data sample included a subset of self reported responses from some 253,680 de-identified subjects. The focus of our predictive modeling efforts is to predict the binary target, which is diabetes status, based on 21 features. Some of these topical features include BP, cholesterol, BMI, smoker status, history of stroke, cardiovascular disease or heart attack, physical activity and various general and mental health parameters as well as demographics such as sex, age, education, income.
